<i>Spurious Correlations</i> was a project I put together as a fun way to look at correlations and to think about data. Empirical research is interesting, and I love to wonder about how variables work together. The charts on this site aren't meant to imply causation nor are they meant to create a distrust for research or even correlative data. Rather, I hope this project fosters interest in statistics and numerical research.<br><br>
<strong>Can I use your charts for...?</strong><br>
Yes. Absolutely. Anything posted on here is released under a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230626014613/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. You can use it for any purpose, even commercial purposes. You have my permission to remix and repost and re-whatever. The condition is generally just that you mention where you got it. You <i>can</i> email me to ask permission, but there's really no reason to. I'm just going to say yes.<br><br> 
<strong>How do I get in touch with you?</strong><br>
If you have questions, comments, or inquiries shoot me an email: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230626014613/mailto:vigentyler@gmail.com">vigentyler@gmail.com</a> (Yes this is a real email that goes into a real folder in my real Gmail inbox.  Turns out webscraping emails went out of fashion years ago so I've never had a problem with spam.)<br><br>
<strong>Why is this all hosted at tylervigen.com?</strong><br>When I created this project, it was just for me and a few friends to see. I use my own name as a hosting platform for works-in-progress and miscellaneous programming projects. I didn't realize at the time that it would be shared so much. At this point, it's difficult to backtrack from the SEO, so I've just rolled with it.<br><br>
<strong>How do you pronounce your last name?</strong><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230626014613/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen">"Vee-gen,"</a> with the "g" having the same sound as in the word "game." Or, since it's easier to remember: "vegan," like I don't consume animal products.<br><br>
<strong>How do I hear about future projects?</strong><br>
If you'd like to hear about future projects, the best way is to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230626014613/https://www.tylervigen.com/subscribe">receive an email</a> right when they're completed. I don't send very many emails. Since 2013, I have sent just two emails to this list.<br><br>
<strong>Why don't you use a copyright?</strong>
